Someone That I Needed
Jason Ross


No one here to talk me off the edge
Cavin' in, I just hold my breath
Maybe I can make the dark a friend
Walk beside me but not get ahead
'Cause my heart beat bleeds into all the wasted time
And every time I sleep I'm afraid of what I'll find
I'm so hard on myself
Lookin' for answers from everyone else
But If I dig real deep, maybe I could change my mind
In the darkness
Close my eyes and breath in
Focus on the feeling
Floating through the ceiling
Is the secret
Hiding underneath this
Mess of broken pieces
I'm someone I believe in
Someone that I needed
Someone that I needed, needed, needed, needed
Someone that I needed
Someone that I needed
'Cause my heart beat bleeds into all the wasted time
And every time I sleep I'm afraid of what I'll find
I'm so hard on myself
Lookin' for answers from everyone else
But If I dig real deep, maybe I could change my mind
In the darkness
Close my eyes and breath in
Focus on the feeling
Floating through the ceiling
Is the secret
Hiding underneath this
Mess of broken pieces
I'm someone I believe in
Someone that I needed
Someone that I needed, needed, needed, needed
Someone that I needed
Someone that I needed
'Cause my heart beat bleeds into all the wasted time
And every time I sleep I'm afraid of what I'll find
I'm so hard on myself
Lookin' for answers from everyone else
But If I dig real deep, maybe I could change my mind
